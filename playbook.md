## Guiding Philosophy

1. Simplicity

2. Productivity

3. Craftsmanship


##Task Management

Task management should prioritize productivity above all else. This couples well with simplicity as simple systems are easy to get started and easy to maintain.

* Use Trello because it makes task management simple.

* The mental model for task management: everything should be divided into verb-oriented tasks and those tasks divided into three simple categories: "Not Started", "In Progress", and "Complete".

* Partition out your day's tasks using a simple to-do list on a white notepad. Don't be afraid to re-write it multiple times.

* Use whiteboards or "back of the napkin" drawings constantly. They're cheap, quick, and quickly get the point across.

##Preferred Languages and Frameworks

Approach technologies as a craftsman approaches a tool: he hopes to be familiar with broad range of them but then deeply invests in a few.

* Life's too short to work with a language you don't love. I prefer Ruby for its readability

* Don't overkill an app with too much framework. For Ruby projects I prefer Rack for very simple applications and Rails for more complex ones.

* Invest in learning JQuery and Javascript because of their ubiquity.

* PostgreSQL almost always gets the job done and there are a ton of resources on it.

* Modularity is appropriate at all levels. For web applications, prefer building a [static app](http://www.staticapps.org/) if possible.

##Dev Environment

Invest in your dev environment but not at the expense of productivity or simplicity. Try and instill a rhythm to your work through TDD and continuous deployment.

* You will spend much more time reading code than you will spend writing it. Optimize to readability 99% of the time

* Embrace test driven development. I prefer RSpec but there are a variety of choices that work.

* Follow [Sandi Metz approach to testing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URSWYvyc42M). It will make sticking to TDD much easier.

* Also embrace continuous deployment. I prefer Travis and Heroku because of their ubiquity.

* Ensure everyone is on the same Git workflow. If you are looking for one start with [Thoughtbot's Git protocol](https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/tree/master/protocol/git)

* They matter less than the hype they garner but do find an editor you can invest in. I prefer doing everything from the command line so I use Vim paired with tmux. I recommend iTerm and Zsh.

* When in doubt, follow the [Ruby Style Guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide)


##Personal

Above all, invest in yourself.

* Write daily for reflection. I prefer a [Moleskine Folio Ruled A4
   Book](http://www.moleskine.com/us/collections/model/product/folio-ruled-book-a4) because it provides lots of room for thinking

* If you write daily invest in a pen you like using. I use the [Lamy Safari Fountain
   Pen](http://www.amazon.com/Lamy-Safari-Fountain-Pen-Charcoal/dp/B0002T401Y)
