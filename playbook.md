## Guiding Philosophy
When at a crossroads, always go back to your core values or guiding philosophy. For me, these are:

* Simplicity

* Productivity

* Craftsmanship


##Task Management

Every aspect of development should incorporate these core values including task management. Here is what task management looks like to me:

* At its core, agile is about optimizing for information rather than pure efficiency. It works because oftentimes our starting assumptions are wrong and the loss from these bad assumptions is greater than the loss of having to do things multiple times as you would with a more iterative approach.

* Embrace the Minimum Viable Product (MVP). Get on the same page about an MVP approach and define what "done" looks like for an MVP. Get to your MVP in a similar manner to how you would get to green doing test-driven development (TDD).

* Craftsmanship requires ownership, rigor, and attention to detail. Its thrust is towards putting out the best final product that you can possible can. It **does not** mean that you will put out that product on the first try. Great writers obsess over constant editing; wood-workers embrace prototyping and an continual improvement. Great developers should embrace moving fast and multiple iterations as an approach to craftsmanship--not in opposition to it.

* Be paranoid about all of the assumptions you make starting a project, particularly if those assumptions are about projects outside of your control. If your project assumes multiple other teams will deliver a required service on time, rethink your own deadline or find a way to build a first iteration without that service.

* Many task management systems are complex and may be overkill for you needs. JIRA provides an enormous amount of metrics and ability to fine-tune your task management but if your team is struggling to be productive on it, scrap it and retreat to something simpler like Trello. Be honest about what works and don't prematurely optimize.

* Have empathy for the customer. In other words, build delightful products for real people, not for abstract use-cases or a given set of specs handed down to you. Sometimes the specs are wrong.

##Technologies

Technologies are both a tool and an investment. Your role as an engineer is to have both a deep expertise in a few and broad familiarity with many others.

* Acknowledge that there are inflection points of learning. Keep these in mind when learning a technology.

* I have found it very difficult to learn a technology unless I have a real life problem to use it for. Perhaps others can but you should know how you learn.

* Of all technologies in your toolbelt, languages are the most personal and important. Your first goal should be deep understanding of at least one language.

##Dev Environment

Invest in your dev environment but not at the expense of productivity or simplicity. Instill a rhythm to your work through TDD and continuous deployment.

* You will spend much more time reading code than you will spend writing it. Optimize to readability most of the time.

* Embrace test driven development--it works.

* Embrace continuous deployment. It will improve the quality of your product and in my opinion give you a much healthier rhythm at work.

* Take the time to ensure everyone is on the same Git workflow. If you are looking for one start with [Thoughtbot's Git protocol](https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/tree/master/protocol/git)

* They matter less than the hype they garner but do find an editor you can invest in. I like to stay close to the command line so I use Vim paired with tmux. I recommend iTerm and Zsh.

* Get a style guide for your team.

##Personal

Above all, invest in yourself. Your character and your skills are the long-term project that you will shape your life and career above anything else.

* Write daily for reflection. I prefer a [Moleskine Folio Ruled A4
   Book](http://www.moleskine.com/us/collections/model/product/folio-ruled-book-a4) because it provides lots of room for thinking

* Realize that you are human and work with other humans. Keep a sense of humor, don't be arrogant, and be someone that others want to work with.
