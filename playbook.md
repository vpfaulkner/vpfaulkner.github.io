## Guiding Philosophy

1. Simplicity

2. Productivity

3. Craftsmanship


##Task Management

Task management should prioritize productivity above all else. For me, simple systems are easy to get started and easy to maintain.

* I like Trello for task management. Projects should be divided into verb-oriented tasks and those tasks divided into three simple categories: "Not Started", "In Progress", and "Complete".

* Every morning, I look at my Trello board and write a simple daily to-do list on a white notepad. I find this helps emphasize the tasks I actually need to get done that day against all of the tasks available in the Trello board.

* I rely heavily on whiteboards or "back of the napkin" drawings. Their cheap, quick, and lend themselves to continually reworking.

##Dev Environment

* I live in iTerm and Zsh because I like the productivity of using an command line
  editor. I prefer Vim paired with tmux.

* You will spend much more time reading code than you will spend writing it. Optimize to readability 99% of the time

##Preferred Languages and Frameworks

* Ruby for its readability 

* Rails for its productivity

* JQuery

* Ember.js

* PostgreSQL


##Dev Ops

* Test driven development with RSpec

* [Sandi Metz approach to testing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URSWYvyc42M)

* Continuous deployment with Travis and Heroku

* [Thoughtbot's Git protocol](https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/tree/master/protocol/git)

* When in doubt, follow the [Ruby Style Guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide)
