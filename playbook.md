## Guiding Philosophy
When at a crossroads, always go back to your core engineering values or guiding philosophy. For me, these are:

* Simplicity

* Productivity

* Craftsmanship

##Personal Workflow

Be honest about what works and start there. Here is what works for me:

* I like Test Driven Development (TDD) because it provides "guard-rails" for my work. It also prevents premature optimization, the biggest source of productivity failures.

* Rhythm is critical to productivity. That's why I value continuous deployment for teams. That's why I also value, small feature / PR scope, Git flow, TDD, and a daily to do list.

* Lists work. I re-write my daily to do list every day, even if it looks pretty similar to yesterday's.

* You will spend much more time reading code than you will spend writing it. Your code should feel like an easy to fall narrative. Your friend who has no idea how to code should get a general sense of what's going on simply based on your naming.

* Create a style guide and follow it. Ideally you should have a corporate style guide.

* At the end of the day, you have to get joy from your work. Craftsmanship stems from the belief that a well-crafted product is a good in and of itself.

##Agile

Agile works because we make bad assumptions. I see Test-Driven Development, Agile workflows, and Customer Discovery as all applying the same fundamental principles in different contexts:

* At its core, agile is about optimizing for information rather than pure efficiency. It works because oftentimes our starting assumptions are wrong and the loss from these bad assumptions is greater than the loss of having to do things multiple times as you would with a more iterative approach.

* Embrace the Minimum Viable Product (MVP). Get on the same page about an MVP approach and define what "done" looks like for an MVP. Get to your MVP in a similar manner to how you would get to green doing test-driven development (TDD).

* Craftsmanship requires ownership, rigor, and attention to detail. Its thrust is towards putting out the best final product that you can possible can. It **does not** mean that you will put out that product on the first try. Great writers obsess over constant editing; wood-workers embrace prototyping and an continual improvement. Great developers should embrace moving fast and multiple iterations as an approach to craftsmanship--not in opposition to it.

* Be paranoid about all of the assumptions you make starting a project, particularly if those assumptions are about projects outside of your control. If your project assumes multiple other teams will deliver a required service on time, rethink your own deadline or find a way to build a first iteration without that service.

* Many task management systems are complex and may be overkill for you needs. JIRA provides an enormous amount of metrics and ability to fine-tune your task management but if your team is struggling to be productive on it, scrap it and retreat to something simpler like Trello. Be honest about what works and don't prematurely optimize.

* Have empathy for the customer. In other words, build delightful products for real people, not for abstract use-cases or a given set of specs handed down to you. Sometimes the specs are wrong.

##Technologies

Technologies are both a tool and an investment. Consequently, I like to have both a deep expertise in a few and broad familiarity with many others.

* Acknowledge that there are inflection points of learning. Keep these in mind when learning a technology.

* I have found it very difficult to learn a technology unless I have a real life problem to use it for. Perhaps others can but you should know how you learn.

* Of all technologies in your toolbelt, languages are the most personal and important. Your first goal should be deep understanding of at least one language. That language for me is Ruby.
