![Me](/public/headshot.jpg)
I'm Vance and I love to solve problems. I crave new companies, new technologies,
new ideas, and obstacles that resist typical solutions.

I have a liberal arts background and was a doing analytics for a SaaS startup before deciding I wanted to go into software
development. As a developer I work primarily in Ruby on Rails and frontend
 web technologies. To see how I work, check out my [playbook](/playbook).

Some of my favorite tools:

* **Languages**: Ruby, Javascript, HTML, CSS

* **Web Frameworks**: Ruby on Rails, Sinatra

* **Frontend Frameworks & Libraries**: jQuery, Middleman, Jekyll, Bourbon, Foundation

* **Dev Ops & Version Control**: Git, Github, Bitbucket, Heroku, Unix

* **Database**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB

* **Testing**: RSpec, Capybara

* **Agile**: JIRA, Trello

* **Other**: Sidekiq, VIM, NSQ, Haml, Sass, Markdown, JSON, rbenv

When not writing software, I am probably reading, with friends, or out running. I am a graduate of the University of North Carolina and reside in Durham, North Carolina.
