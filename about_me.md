![Me](/public/headshot.jpg)
I'm Vance and I love to solve problems. I crave new challenges, new ideas, and obstacles that require me to grow as an engineer.

I have a liberal arts background and was a doing analytics for a SaaS startup before deciding I wanted to go into software development. My primary expertise is with APIs, both designing them and integrating them, but I also have experience with front-end development and DevOps. Additionally in my current role I regularly deal with issues of concurrency, data transformation and integrity, customer support, and scale. To see how I work, check out my [playbook](/playbook).

Some of my favorite tools and technologies:

* **Backend** - Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Sidekiq, Rspec, Capybara

* **Datastore** - MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Redis

* **Frontend** - HTML, Javascript, CSS, SASS, jQuery, AJAX, Websockets, Bootstrap, SemanticUI, Foundation

* **Infrastructure** - Linux/Unix, AWS, DigitalOcean, Docker, Nginx, TravisCI, Codeship, Jenkins, Heroku

* **Monitoring** - Rollbar, Graylog, Grafana, New Relic, StatsD, Kibana

* **Agile** - JIRA, Trello

* **Other** - Git, Github, Vim

When not writing software, I am probably reading, with friends, or out running. I am a graduate of the University of North Carolina and reside in Durham, North Carolina.
