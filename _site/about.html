          <h2 id="agile">Agile</h2>
          <p>Agile works because we make bad assumptions. At its core, agile is about optimizing for information rather than pure efficiency. It works because oftentimes our starting assumptions are wrong and the loss from these bad assumptions is greater than the loss of having to do things multiple times as you would with a more iterative approach. I rely on the following habits to enforce an agile workflow:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Daily standups</li>
            <li>1 week sprint cycles</li>
            <li>Simple, "t-shirt" sized story scoping</li>
            <li>A daily groomed Trello board</li>
            <li>A single work-in-progress workflow</li>
            <li>Problem-based product discovery</li>
            <li>Lightweight wireframes before every feature</li>
            <li>Multi-phased roll out</li>
            <li>Technical spikes to deal with non-obvious technical problems</li>
            <li>Timeboxing to short-circut scope creep</li>
          </ul>
          <h2 id="checklists">Checklists</h2>
          <p>Every day I write a new checklist. I used to pick right up with the checklist that I had the day before, but I've found that starting a new one every day somehow makes it feel like I'm starting from a new slate.</p>
          <img id="todo-img" src="/todo-list.png" />
          <p>I try to ensure that everything I'm working on lines up with a todo. If I get pulled off onto a distriction (bug in production for example) I'll add it to the top of the checklist then tackle it. This way, the checklist also serves as a mental map.</p>
          <h2 id="development-environment">Development Environment</h2>
          <p>My setup is as follows:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>MacBook Pro</li>
            <li>Zsh Shell</li>
            <li>iTerm2</li>
            <li>Vim</li>
            <li>tmux</li>
            <li>Screenhero or tmate for remote pairing</li>
            <li>Slack</li>
            <li>Git / GitHub</li>
            <li>Gmail</li>
          </ul>
          <h2 id="git">Git</h2>
          <p>My preferred Git branching model is as follows:
          <ul>
            <li>New features should be done on seperate branches</li>
            <li>Changes to Master can only be made via GitHub pull requests</li>
            <li>All pull requests must be approved by at least 1 reviewer</li>
            <li>All pull requests must have a green test suite</li>
            <li>All pull requests must have no linting errors according an agreed upon style guide</li>
            <li>Prior to being merged pull requests should be rebased / squashed to a few or even a single commit with meaningful messages that describe the change</li>
            <li>Longer features should be avoided or, at the very least, be visible to the rest of the team during development as WIP PRs with a Markdown checklist on the PR description</li>
            <li>Branch names and PR descriptions should match the feature or bug's Trello card</li>
          </ul>
          <h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>
          <p>I prefer TDD with tests being run in "watch mode" via something like <a href="https://github.com/guard/guard-test">guard-test</a>. In fact, my development environment is oftentimes tests on one external monitor, the code I am developing an another external monitor, and guard tests on my laptop in the middle.</p>
          <h2 id="working-remotely">Working Remotely</h2>
          <p>Thriving remotely requires a lot of self-imposed structure. For example, I start workingly roughly the same time everyday (7:30 am), I only work from my desk, I dress in work appropriate clothes, and I end work at roughly the same time (5:00 pm).</p>

          <h2>Costing App for Blue Apron</h2>
          <h3>Background</h3>
          <p>Worked alongside one other developer to build a web app used by the Blue Apron team for costing. This was a four month project and provided an immediate impact on how ingredient sourcing and costing is done at Blue Apron.</p>
          <h3>Technologies</h3>
          <p>The app is a <a target="_blank" href="https://staticapps.org/">static app</a> with a completely separate client served independantly from the API. We used Rails for the back-end API, React / Redux for the front-end client, and integrated with other internal systems via JSON APIs compliant with the <a target="_blank" href="http://jsonapi.org/">JSON API spec</a>.</p>
          <h3>My Role</h3>
          <p>Being part of only a two person team I was heavily involved in the app's development, planning, QA, and support. Additionally, this project required constant collaboration with multiple stakeholders including the sourcing team making up its end-users as well as the Blue Apron internal tech team responsible for providing downstream data sources.</p>
          <h3>Impact</h3>
          <p>The app's impact was immediate allowing the team to retire a bloated legacy system and transition from time-consuming manual workflow. It also provided critical costing metrics unlocking opportunities for saving not previously visible from the old system. Finally, the project was finished under an aggressive deadline without significant downtime or negative impact to day-to-day operations.</p>
          <h2>Rails Sandbox</h2>
          <h3>Background</h3>
          <p>A technology I used consistently called Ruby on Rails embraces a mantra of <a target="blank" href="http://rubyonrails.org/doctrine/#convention-over-configuration">convention over configuration</a>. The idea is simple: the vast majority of your project requirements will be standard ones with which you can take advantage of well defined conventions. However, remembering some of these conventions can be difficult and for this I created an open source tool to provide a code generator to illustrate these conventions.</p>
          <h3>Technologies</h3>
          <p>This project was started just months after Rails 5 was released, and I was particularly eager to use <a target="_blank" href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_cable_overview.html">Action Cable</a>, Rails built-in interface for the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket">WebSocket</a> protocol. In addition, I wanted to take full ownership of the full stack including deployment. As a result, the stack was:
          <ul>
            <li>Ruby on Rails including Action Cable</li>
            <li>jQuery</li>
            <li>Semantic UI</li>
            <li>Docker</li>
            <li>NGINX</li>
            <li>Digitial Ocean Linux Ubuntu Droplet</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Developer Portal for Validic</h2>
          <h3>Background</h3>
          <p>One of my primary roles for <a target="_blank" href="https://validic.com/">Validic</a> was working on their partner API and a major accomplishment as part of this was getting their developer portal. A developer portal is a place for developers to get everything they need to build and manage their connection to our API product including technical documentation, credentials, account settings, etc. Previous to this, all interactions with our partners was done via email in a time-consuming, unsecure manner. By providing this developer portal we were able to make the process of integrating with our system faster, easier, and more secure. You can find the portal online at: <a target="_blank" href="https://partner.validic.com/">partner.validic.com</a>
          <img id="validic-partner-portal" src="/validic_partner_portal.png" />
          <h3>Technologies</h3>
          <p>The app was built using Rails, PostgreSQL, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and integrated with our other services via JSON API calls. It was deployed to AWS using Docker and Jenkins.</p>
          <h2>Partner and Mobile API for Validic</h2>
          <h3>Background</h3>
          <p>One of my initial projects for Validic was getting their partner API, Validic Connect, off of the ground. Through this API, partners with mobile health apps and devices could integrate with the Validic ecosystem and allow their users to integrate their account with dozens of other partners. For the first year of its development I led Validic Connect's design, development, documentation, and support.</p>
          <p>Additionally I was the primary server-side developer for our private API serving the mobile app. This involved continuous coordination with the separate mobile team and careful rollout of new features, version changes, and bug fixes</p>
          <h3>Technologies</h3>
          <p>Both APIs were served by Ruby on Rails with MongoDB as the primary datastore. Additionally, media files such as images were stored in S3.</p>
          <h3>Impact</h3>
          <p>Today, dozens of healthcare and wellness companies are integrated with the Validic Connect API providing a large portion of the Validic ecosystem. Additionally, 6+ million requests per day are handled by the private Mobile API which serves as the primary integration point for popular native apps such as Apple Health</p>
