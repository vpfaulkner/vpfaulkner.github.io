<h2 id="guiding-philosophy">Guiding Philosophy</h2>
<p>When at a crossroads, always have your guiding philosophies to refer to. Continuously connect the details and “in the weeds” decisions you make each day to the big picture and abstract ideas you are following.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Simplicity</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Productivity</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Craftsmanship</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="task-management">Task Management</h2>

<p>Task management should prioritize productivity above all else. This couples well with simplicity as simple systems are easy to get started and easy to maintain.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Use whiteboards or “back of the napkin” drawings constantly. They’re cheap, effective, and quickly get the point across.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most task management systems are overly-complicated and are difficult to keep up to date. If you’re having trouble keeping it up to date, scrap it and use something simpler like Trello.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My preferred mental model for task management: everything should be divided into verb-oriented tasks and those tasks divided into three simple categories: “Not Started”, “In Progress”, and “Complete”.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Partition out your day’s tasks using a simple to-do list on a white notepad. Don’t be afraid to re-write it multiple times.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="preferred-languages-and-frameworks">Preferred Languages and Frameworks</h2>

<p>Approach technologies as a craftsman approaches a tool: he hopes to be familiar with broad range of them but then deeply invests in a few. Take ownership in your tools but don’t fixate on them more than what you are trying build.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Life’s too short to work with a language you don’t love. I prefer Ruby for its readability.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Don’t overkill an app with too much framework. For Ruby projects I prefer Rack for very simple applications and Rails for more complex ones.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Learn JQuery and Javascript because of their ubiquity.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>PostgreSQL almost always gets the job done and there are a ton of resources on it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Modularity is appropriate at all levels. For web applications, prefer building a <a href="http://www.staticapps.org/">static app</a> if possible.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="dev-environment">Dev Environment</h2>

<p>Invest in your dev environment but not at the expense of productivity or simplicity. Try and instill a rhythm to your work through TDD and continuous deployment.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>You will spend much more time reading code than you will spend writing it. Optimize to readability 99% of the time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Embrace test driven development. I prefer RSpec but there are a ton of choices that work.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Follow <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URSWYvyc42M">Sandi Metz approach to testing</a>. It will make sticking to TDD much easier.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also embrace continuous deployment. I prefer Travis and Heroku because of their ubiquity.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ensure everyone is on the same Git workflow. If you are looking for one start with <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/tree/master/protocol/git">Thoughtbot’s Git protocol</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They matter less than the hype they garner but do find an editor you can invest in. I prefer doing everything from the command line so I use Vim paired with tmux. I recommend iTerm and Zsh.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When in doubt, follow a style guide. I usually defer to the <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide">Ruby Style Guide</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="personal">Personal</h2>

<p>Above all, invest in yourself. Your character and your skills are the long-term project that you are really working on.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Write daily for reflection. I prefer a <a href="http://www.moleskine.com/us/collections/model/product/folio-ruled-book-a4">Moleskine Folio Ruled A4
 Book</a> because it provides lots of room for thinking</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Keep a mental or actual checklist of people you want to emulate as well as those that you don’t. The easiest way to change yourself is to through a mentor and role model.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you write daily invest in a pen you like using. I use the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lamy-Safari-Fountain-Pen-Charcoal/dp/B0002T401Y">Lamy Safari Fountain
 Pen</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>
