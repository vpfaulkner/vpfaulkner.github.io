<p>Your interaction with your computer comes in the form of input and output, more commonly referred to as IO. It is essentially how you are able to interact with your computer through keystrokes, mouse clicks, etc. as well as how it returns data back to you. Picture a highway of bytes, or rather 3 “streams” of bytes heading to the main CPU.</p>

<p>The three streams for IO by default are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Standard input</li>
  <li>Standard output</li>
  <li>Standard error</li>
</ul>

<p>Ruby has abstracted these IO streams using the IO class. This class is the basis for all input and output for Ruby but your interaction with the IO class is mostly behind the scenes. For example, one of the most used methods in Ruby, the puts method is actually a method for an IO object:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="vg">$stdout</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">puts</span> <span class="s2">"hello"</span>

<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="n">hello</span>

<span class="vg">$stdout</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">puts</span> <span class="s2">"hello"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"goodbye"</span>

<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="n">hello</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="n">goodbye</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>You obviously are not used to sending puts to $stdout or at least you aren’t aware of it. Thats because $stdout is a global variable by default point to the constant STDOUT which also in turn points to a IO object wrapping the standard out stream. So how have you been able to simply write puts all this time without sending it to $stdout? It turns out that the Kernal module, included in the Object class and whose module methods can be called without an explicate receiver, aliases the puts method to $stdout.puts.</p>
