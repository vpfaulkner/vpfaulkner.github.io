<p>There is nothing worse than trying to fix code without a debugger. Since
starting with Ruby, Pry has become perhaps the most essential tool for me to
be productive and happy. <a href="http://pryrepl.org/">Pry</a> is the de facto standard for
Ruby and acts as a debugger and alternative to IRB.</p>

<p>Install the Gem:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">gem install pry</code></pre></figure>

<p>Ensure pry is available in your Ruby file and drop binding.pry in:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="c1"># test.rb</span>
<span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s1">'pry'</span>

<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">A</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">hello</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"hello world!"</span> <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">A</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span>

<span class="c1"># start a REPL session</span>
<span class="nb">binding</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">pry</span>

<span class="c1"># program resumes here (after pry session)</span>
<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"program resumes here.</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This will open up a Pry session where you can investigate the program state at
that point and begin debugging.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span class="gp">pry(main)&gt; </span>a.hello
hello world!
<span class="gp">=&gt; </span>nil
<span class="gp">pry(main)&gt; </span>puts x
10
<span class="gp">=&gt; </span>nil</code></pre></figure>

<p>The closer you get to your code the smaller your feedback loops, the more
quickly youâ€™ll be productive. Instead of trying to guess what a variable is at
that point in the program, just drop a pry in and find out for sure.</p>

<p>I prefer to use this approach most with a test driven development workflow where
I am constantly invoking the debugging session by running the particular
test I am working on.</p>
