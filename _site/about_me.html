Iâ€™m Vance and I love to solve problems. I crave new challenges, new ideas and obstacles that require me to grow as an engineer.</p>

<p>I have a liberal arts background and was a doing analytics for a SaaS startup before deciding I wanted to go into software development. My primary expertise is with APIs, both designing them and integrating them, but I also have experience with front-end development and DevOps. Additionally in my current role I regularly deal with issues of concurrency, data transformation and integrity, customer support, and scale. To see how I work, check out my <a href="/playbook">playbook</a>.</p>

<p>Some of my favorite tools and technologies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Backend</strong> - Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Sidekiq, Rspec, Capybara</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Datastore</strong> - MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Redis</p>
  </li>
