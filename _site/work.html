  <h2>Costing App for Blue Apron</h2>
  <h3>Background</h3>
  <p>Worked alongside one other developer to build a web app used by the Blue Apron team for costing. This was a four month project and provided an immediate impact on how ingredient sourcing and costing is done at Blue Apron.</p>
  <h3>Technologies</h3>
  <p>The app is a <a target="_blank" href="https://staticapps.org/">static app</a> with a completely separate client served independantly from the API. We used Rails for the back-end API, React / Redux for the front-end client, and integrated with other internal systems via JSON APIs compliant with the <a target="_blank" href="http://jsonapi.org/">JSON API spec</a>.</p>
  <h3>My Role</h3>
  <p>Being part of only a two person team I was heavily involved in the app's development, planning, QA, and support. Additionally, this project required constant collaboration with multiple stakeholders including the sourcing team making up its end-users as well as the Blue Apron internal tech team responsible for providing downstream data sources.</p>
  <h3>Impact</h3>
  <p>The app's impact was immediate allowing the team to retire a bloated legacy system and transition from time-consuming manual workflow. It also provided critical costing metrics unlocking opportunities for saving not previously visible from the old system. Finally, the project was finished under an aggressive deadline without significant downtime or negative impact to day-to-day operations.</p>
  <h2>Rails Sandbox</h2>
  <h3>Background</h3>
  <p>A technology I used consistently called Ruby on Rails embraces a mantra of <a target="blank" href="http://rubyonrails.org/doctrine/#convention-over-configuration">convention over configuration</a>. The idea is simple: the vast majority of your project requirements will be standard ones with which you can take advantage of well defined conventions. However, remembering some of these conventions can be difficult and for this I created an open source tool to provide a code generator to illustrate these conventions.</p>
  <h3>Technologies</h3>
  <p>This project was started just months after Rails 5 was released, and I was particularly eager to use <a target="_blank" href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_cable_overview.html">Action Cable</a>, Rails built-in interface for the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket">WebSocket</a> protocol. In addition, I wanted to take full ownership of the full stack including deployment. As a result, the stack was:
  <ul>
    <li>Ruby on Rails including Action Cable</li>
    <li>jQuery</li>
    <li>Semantic UI</li>
    <li>Docker</li>
    <li>NGINX</li>
    <li>Digitial Ocean Linux Ubuntu Droplet</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Developer Portal for Validic</h2>
  <h3>Background</h3>
  <p>One of my primary roles for <a target="_blank" href="https://validic.com/">Validic</a> was working on their partner API and a major accomplishment as part of this was getting their developer portal. A developer portal is a place for developers to get everything they need to build and manage their connection to our API product including technical documentation, credentials, account settings, etc. Previous to this, all interactions with our partners was done via email in a time-consuming, unsecure manner. By providing this developer portal we were able to make the process of integrating with our system faster, easier, and more secure. You can find the portal online at: <a target="_blank" href="https://partner.validic.com/">partner.validic.com</a>
  <img id="validic-partner-portal" src="/validic_partner_portal.png" />
  <h3>Technologies</h3>
  <p>The app was built using Rails, PostgreSQL, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and integrated with our other services via JSON API calls. It was deployed to AWS using Docker and Jenkins.</p>
  <h2>Partner and Mobile API for Validic</h2>
  <h3>Background</h3>
  <p>One of my initial projects for Validic was getting their partner API, Validic Connect, off of the ground. Through this API, partners with mobile health apps and devices could integrate with the Validic ecosystem and allow their users to integrate their account with dozens of other partners. For the first year of its development I led Validic Connect's design, development, documentation, and support.</p>
  <p>Additionally I was the primary server-side developer for our private API serving the mobile app. This involved continuous coordination with the separate mobile team and careful rollout of new features, version changes, and bug fixes</p>
  <h3>Technologies</h3>
  <p>Both APIs were served by Ruby on Rails with MongoDB as the primary datastore. Additionally, media files such as images were stored in S3.</p>
  <h3>Impact</h3>
  <p>Today, dozens of healthcare and wellness companies are integrated with the Validic Connect API providing a large portion of the Validic ecosystem. Additionally, 6+ million requests per day are handled by the private Mobile API which serves as the primary integration point for popular native apps such as Apple Health</p>
