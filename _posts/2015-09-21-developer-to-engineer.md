title: Developer to Engineer
---

There is a real difference between someone who embraces a developer mindset vs engineer mindset when creating software. Everyone will start out in the former camp and will be frustrated by the amount of time it takes to get to the other, mainly because of the different requirements it asks of you.

A software engineer can do more than write code; she is more a problem solver with a better understanding of the technical context in which that code operates. That second part has been a particular focus of mine with progress slow going, but bridging that gap takes time. To do so, I've attempted to follow a little more structured curriculum for learning:

## Step 1: Learn your Database
There is usually a tradeoff between learning for the short-run and the long-run but learning you database helps with both. You will be able to use what you learn most likely in your day to day but many of the topics you will be learning will also apply to other databases you may encounter in the future.

## Step 2: Learn about Networks
If you are in the web stack, knowing how the networks work and how the internet works is a must-have. There are several all-in-one networking books and your focus should be on knowing things from the bottom up including how Internet Protocol (IP) works, HTTP, routing, TCP, etc.

## Step 3: Learn how Linux Works
Particularly if you are in a language like Ruby which does so many things for you, it can be difficult to really understand what is happening "underneath" the code you are writing on the operating system level. In particular, understanding how Linux processes works will be helpful as you focus more and more on asynchronous tasks.

## Step 4: Learn a Virtualization technology
My goal for instance is to feel very comfortable with how virtual machines and how Docker, a very new and hot virtualization technology, works. These concepts will be made much easier if you have a foundational understanding of Networks and Linux.

## Step 5: Learn a new Language
Little as you are aware of it, the language you work in most is only one of many different paradigms. In particular, learning a functional language if you have not already will stretch you. As you learn new languages you will also begin to see both different design patterns as different languages tend to encourage different ones as well as common language patterns that you should become familiar with.
