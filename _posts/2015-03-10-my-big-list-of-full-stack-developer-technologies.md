title: My Big List of Full Stack Developer Technologies
---
Let's be honest, there are a lot of skills that go into being a full stack developer. There is a long and constantly changing list of core technologies and deciding how to invest your time in learning new ones is almost as important deciding to actually learn some of these in the first place.

My philosophy is:
1. Realize that you can take on about half of what you hope to (if you are being honest) and therefore being focused and intentional about your learning is key
2. Think in terms of inflection points of payoff. I say that having done at least one project with a technology (not just researching it) is an inflection point for familiarity. Try to go wide here is key. Then pick a few things that you want to be an "expert" in. For me, I want to be "an expert" in writing clean, object-oriented Ruby. This is expertise is another inflection point.
3. Mix cutting edge, promising but unproven technologies with tried and true ones. Similar to the previous point, think of the tried and true technologies as conservative, reliable investments because, paradoxically, the longer a technology has been around the longer it is likely to stay around. Think of cutting edge technologies as a venture capitalist would think of investments: long shot bets that might pay off but don't count an any one technology as a sure thing.
4. Above all, learn what you love

With that, here is the list of technologies I have on my list:
